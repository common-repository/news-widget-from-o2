== Description ==

The O2 Widget is a great way to enrich your WordPress powered site by displaying the very latest news from the UK's leading mobile operator, O2 in your sidebar. The O2 Widget updates automatically to display snippets of the latest posts from the O2 Blog (http://blog.o2.co.uk/), providing you with rich content that sits on your pages. The headlines of each story hyperlink to the relevant post on the O2 blog enabling your visitors to read the stories in full. The Blog is updated on a regular basis so you're assured of showing fresh content on your own WordPress site. If you have an Affiliate Window account, simply add your handle within the widget panel and you can earn commission on any sales generating from those clicks.
